This is my project that I am doing with Jason Lin. For our project we are a creating a line graph that contains 10 lines. The line graphs are about the number of unemployment in the top 5 states in the US and the lowest 5 populated stated with unemployment. We are comparing thses states to answer the question if the density of the population in a state has an affect on unemployment. To run this the code to get the graph you need to download the index.html file and the Rates.CSV file. From doing this project we learned how to append multipl lines to the graph,to give color to the lines on the graph, and that population density does have an effect on unemployment.
