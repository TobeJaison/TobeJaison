This is my project that I am doing with Jason Lin. For our project we are a creating a line graph that contains 10 lines. The line graphs are about the number of unemployment in the top 5 states in the US and the lowest 5 populated stated with unemployment. We are comparing thses states to answer the question if the density of the population in a state has an affect on unemployment
